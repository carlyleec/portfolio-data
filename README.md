# portfolio-data
A collection of markdown files and other assets used to build my personal website(s), associated backend datasources, and for just general playing around with data.


### Here's what I'm thinking

There will be a number of directories containing markdown files with front matter that contain information from my resume. I could then use [markdown-to-json](https://github.com/scottstanfield/markdown-to-json) to convert the markdown files to one or serveral JSON files. The JSON file(s) could then be used as seed data for a database or integrated into a client side app (like via webpack jsonloader). 

I also want to include image and svg assets in this repo, to used by other apps.
